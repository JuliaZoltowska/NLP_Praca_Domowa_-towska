# 2. Model description


# 3. Instructions
There are 2 jupyter files on the repository. In 1 there is data cleaning, presentation of distribution, built model using LSTM recurrent network, built model using CNN network and model with pre-trained word embeddings. For all of them, too, functions have been created that use the trained model and return a result for the passed single sentence(s) in the form of a message telling the user whether the text is spam or not.

The second file contains the described model with a fine-tuning of the Robert-spam language model also with a function that uses the trained model and returns the result for the passed single sentence(s) in the form of a message informing the user whether the text is spam or not.
